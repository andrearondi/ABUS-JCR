"""Single source of truth for coordinate conventions, schemas, and thresholds.

No magic numbers anywhere else in the package: every geometry/metric constant
is defined here and imported. These values are *re-verified* locally on the
Validation split (see ``scripts/phase0a_*`` and the double-check test), never
assumed.

Coordinate spaces (Inv. 6 — one space):
- **Storage order** ``(d0, d1, d2)`` — NRRD/numpy array indexing. ``d0`` is the
  largest axis for this dataset. Internal representation for masks/candidates.
- **Official/ITK order** ``(x, y, z)`` — the space ``det_score.py`` scores in.
  Reached from storage by the self-inverse permutation ``PERM_STORAGE_TO_ITK``.

The official scoring space is **native voxel indices, ITK (x, y, z) order,
centre + full extent**.
